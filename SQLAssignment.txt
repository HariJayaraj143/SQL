1.Inner Join

Definition: Returns only the matching records from both tables where the condition is met.

Example:SELECT Employees.ID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;

2.Left Join
Definition:InLEFT JOIN, for each row in the left table, matched rows from the right table are combined. 
If there is no match, NULL values are assigned to the right half of the rows in the temporary table.

Example:SELECT Employees.ID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;

3.Right Join
Definition:InLEFT JOIN, for each row in the left table, matched rows from the right table are combined. 
If there is no match, NULL values are assigned to the right half of the rows in the temporary table.

Example:SELECT Employees.ID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;

4.Cross Join
Definition: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every row from Table A is combined with every row from Table B).

Example:SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
CROSS JOIN Departments;

5.Full Join
Definition: Returns all records from both tables, with NULLs where there is no match.

Example:SELECT Employees.ID, Employees.Name, Departments.DeptName
FROM Employees
FULL JOIN Departments ON Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID;

6.Self Join
Definition: Joins a table with itself to find relationships within the same table.

Example:SELECT E1.Name AS Employee, E2.Name AS Manager
FROM Employees E1
JOIN Employees E2 ON E1.ManagerID = E2.ID;
